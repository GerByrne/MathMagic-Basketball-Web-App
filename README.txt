Final Year Project/Thesis: (Investigation into the Extent and Limitations of Dynamism and Interaction through Web Applications)

Involved a study of contemporary web apps through technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

Implementation involved the development of a cross-browser desktop web application and an accompanying mobile web app.

The main purpose of developing these web-based apps was to test their relevant technologies and associated APIs to discover if they truly are a valid alternative to native desktop and mobile apps.

Techniques such as the Document Object Model and frameworks such as jQuery and PhoneGap were also utilized and capitalised upon to investigate these comparisons.
